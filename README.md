# Technical Interview Helper - Backend

This project was built in a day, as part of a Hack-Day event. It uses MongoDB, ExpressJS and quotes are generated with the Techy API. The frontend was made using Create React App, in Typescript and can be found in a separate repository.

The project includes a working system for account creation, user login and saving data to user profiles.

## Tech Stack
This project was built using:
- React (using Create React App - see frontend repo - TechInterviewHelper)
- Express
- MongoDB

## Areas for Improvement

Given the time-limit, there are areas that I would like to improve upon. These are:

- Error handling, in the event of a backend disconnect.
- Hashing passwords in the database.


## Usage

This Project is more proof-of-concept and for entertainment only. It is not a "useful" product, albeit the application of the code has been a great learning experience. Please don't use it for actual interviews!
